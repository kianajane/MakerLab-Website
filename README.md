## MakerLab website

The website for the Brandeis MakerLab, visible in its current form [here](http://brandeismakerlab.com).

I do not maintain the Brandeis MakerLab website currently, and it is not hosted through Github pages. The code is saved here for posterity.

If you are working with the website and need more information/access to any setup accounts, please contact me or Ian for the Google doc.
