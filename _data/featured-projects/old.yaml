  description: "A Collaboration with artist Tommy Hartung creating 3D sculptures for film projects at the Rose Art Museum. Devi is a double majoring in Computer Science and Film, Television, and Interactive Media, and spends her time making tech and art projects with the Getz Media Lab, Deis3D, VR Club, and other groups around Brandeis. She is currently working with the Makerlab as a Maker-in-Residence bringing together art and technology through 3D printing. Working with artist and filmmaker Tommy Hartung, I am creating 3D printed figures that Hartung will be using on animations and experimentation with new materials. These short films, along with the figures, will be on display in an upcoming solo exhibition at the Rose Art Museum."

  description: "Can neurofeedback aid a mindfulness meditation practice using a consumer EEG? Muse claims that is what their product does, but there is little public scientific data supporting this claim. I first became interested in the question after reading an opinion article on the subject published in 2013. Brandmeyer and Delorme suggest that in theory neurofeedback could help beginner meditators by alerting them when their mind wanders. I've designed an experiment(attached in email) that has already been approved by the Brandeis Institutional Review Board to test this theory with the Emotiv, however I would need to purchase Emotiv's Raw EEG Software to be able to publish my research. This software however is too expensive, and only allows a very limited number of recordings. Instead I would like to purchase an OpenBCI setup, and redesign my experiment for it. For my experiment, I will need to collect EEG data for 2 purposes: quantifying success in the interventions and giving subjects feedback when their mind wanders, like the muse does. One study has found that theta and delta activity increase during mind wandering while alpha and beta decrease, so I will give real-time feedback along these lines. I will do preliminary tests with many other feedback algorithms before deciding which to use the actual experiment. The OpenBCI system will provide me not only with all of the hardware, but also a lot of useful software. The GUI it comes with will be a lot more informative than the software I have now for the Emotiv, such as live graphing of data. Additionally, I will be able to place the electrodes wherever I want rather than using Emotiv's fixed headset. OpenVibe software will allow me to easily design and test different feedback algorithms."

  description: "I am building a life size model of the Master Sword from the Legend of Zelda. I am interested in this further advance my skills in 3D printing as well as develop new skills including sand-casting, welding, and working in a metal workshop. As this project will help me advance my skills in craftsmanship, it also brings a nostalgic benefit and be therapeutically relaxing and exciting. Being able to fully complete my first ever large project like this will bring me an incredible sense of achievement and joy. After the sword is complete, I do hope to print a life-size stand that was seen in the Temple of Time in the game to hold the prop. The advantage of building the sword also provides a marketing benefit, because each of these swords that are sold by Nintendo cost around 1000-2000 thousand dollars, where we can produce a metal Master Sword costing near 400$ total and sell it for a cheaper price of 750$. Any amount sold higher than its cost, will be a profit and those additional funds can provide assistance for other projects."

- name: Balance Maintanance Study
  description: "Sacha Panic was a PhD graduate student in cognitive neuroscience. In his dissertation research he studied how people maintain balance, and the role that the vision, the inner ear's balance organ, and gravity plays in that. He took some data from one of his experiments, and turned that into a 3D printed sculpture that represents that data in such a way that one can gain a different understanding from it, compared to \"just\" looking at a 2D graph on a screen. This was a collaboration with Vivekanand Pandey Vimal (who provided the data) and Alberto Pierobon (who helped with designing the stand) and Brandeis University LTS Maker Lab."

- name: Waltham High School Summer Program
  description: "Summer 2015 we had six Waltham High School students participate in a program (designed by Vivekanand Pandey Vimal, Professor Krummel, Anique Olivier-Mason and Eduardo Beltrame), where they learned about Biochemistry and DNA, with 3D printed molecules to help them visualize. You can read more about this program at Brandeis Library and Technology Services' blog. PhD researcher Vivek got a Spark grant through the HFIC to bring half a dozen Waltham High School students into a program of hands-on research in Brandeis science labs. In partnership with Brandeis’s MRSEC division, Vivek assembled a team of ten graduate students and staff to teach lessons on the fundamental building blocks of biology. The MakerLab assisted in 3D printing molecular models including a capstone project that was a 5 foot tall DNA strand."

  description: "Priyam Shah, an undergraduate from the Neuroscience department created House of the Vettii, a Roman townhouse located in the ancient city of Pompeii. The house is two-scale, as it was in Rome, you can walk around and meet virtual people — shopkeepers, even people playing chess on the steps of the Roman Basilica."

  description: "Daniela Dimitrova an undergraduate from the Fine Arts department, who also came to the MakerLab thinking that virtual reality and 3D printing were science fiction. In collaboration with another undergraduate she founded the Virtual Reality club. She learned Unity and Unreal Engine and created a lighting-accurate copy of the Rose Art Museum, where they can not only prestage exhibits to see how they will flow in the space, they can re-create past exhibits that no longer exist -- including Louise Nevelson’s exhibit from the 1960’s that was lost in a fire. After creating the virtual space, Daniela created a 1:1 scale copy of the artwork lost in the fire, 3D printing over 20 pieces that assembled into a photo-realistic recreation of the lost sculpture."
