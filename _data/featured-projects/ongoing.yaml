- name: A Different Kind of Disaster by Christie DeNizio and Stephanie Gonzalez-Turner
  description: "Our project will generate 3D printed artifacts from digitally simulated material collisions, fixing in physical form all aspects of this hypothetical impact. Our intention is to create a generative recursion between a digital, ideal space and real space in order to create a series of mixed reality sculptures. We are interested in the translation between the virtual and physical manifestation of fixed material collisions, which we anticipate will result in both information loss and accumulation. We want to investigate how the noise generated by the translation process - the residue of moving between two realities- will affect the creation an abstract form and open up a new space of interpretation for “the disaster.” The final sculptures will be cast in a variety of materials and suspended by, and break out of, a linear cubic geometry as a reference to the aesthetics of data visualizations. The final form will speak to both macro collisions such as meteors colliding with planets, as well as micro particle collisions in scientific instruments."

- name: The Physics of Atol Water Lensing by Steven Tarr
  description: "My project is in collaboration with Professors Bulbul Chakraborty of the Physics Department and Aida Wong of the East Asian Studies Department. We intend to construct a large model of an atoll island and it's unique hydrogeological structures using mostly digital fabrication processes. With this model, we will run experiments to see first-hand how different climactic and geological factors can affect the formation of a freshwater lens in the groundwater. Additionally, the model will be used as an interactive, museum-style exhibit for the exhibition on campus in November that will address the environmental, cultural, and geological aspects of these islands."

- name: Library Loanable Protein Models by Eduardo De Veiga Beltrame
  description: "Over the last 3 years, the MakerLab has been assembling the knowledge and techniques to render and 3D print exquisite molecular models. Undergraduate Eduardo Beltrame '16 has championed this work, developing an workflow for taking an atomic coordinate data set from the Protein Data Bank and rendering it in a molecular visualizer such that complex models can be created at very low cost using fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printers. Eduardo came to Brandeis in 2014 having never seen a 3D printer before, started printing molecules for fun and to use as a teaching aid, and in 2017 published an <a href=https://www.jove.com/video/55427/3d-printing-of-biomolecular-models-for-research-and-pedagogy>original workflow</a> in the Journal of Visual Experimentation (JOVE). Today more than 50 original molecules are available to check out from the Circulation Desk in the Goldfarb Library."

- name: Brandeis Prosthesis Club
  description: "Brandeis Prosthesis Club has completed a 3D printed hand for its first e-NABLE recipient in Ghana! e-NABLE is a network of volunteers who 3D print and assemble prosthetic hands and arms for children around the world. If you’d like to learn more about e-NABLE, check out their website here: http://enablingthefuture.org. For our summer project, we printed a Phoenix Hand, a design in which the user pushes his or her palm against the device in order to bend the fingers. We are very excited to get started on more hands in the Fall!"
